WRCBash!
=======

A simple top-perspective WRC game

This project abandoned. If you want to use it, rewrite it, do as you
please. I would love to hear about the work you made, or changes. 

The game supports simble AABB collisions (but on the test map there are
no colliders so you will have to fork and add own actors to test it). Sound
 works through SoundManager2, I have just added crossfading looping sounds.
Track loading works through JSON data format. There is no preloading screen
but it's fairly easy to add one, no scoreboard and no menu screen.

Project was abandoned due to audio sound loop problem (crossfading partialy
fixes the problem) and canvas rendering speed on some platforms (ex. tablets).

Please bare in mind, that this software is distributed "as is" without
any guarantees. I'm not responsible for any damage done with it or the
way anybody uses it.

That said, have fun.
